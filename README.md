# Backend API for Formula1 project üèéÔ∏è
This is the backend part of the Formula1 project, built using C# and .NET. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing Formula 1 data, including drivers, teams and races. The backend interacts with a database using Entity Framework Core and supports varios API actions for managing and retrieving data. 
  Frontend part: https://github.com/annabelleraaberg/ReactApplication.git 

## Setup
